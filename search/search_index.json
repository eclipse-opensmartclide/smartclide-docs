For more general information about the SmartCLIDE project visit our website . About the project The main objective of SmartCLIDE is to propose a radically new smart cloud-native development environment, based on the coding-by-demonstration principle, that will support creators of cloud services in the discovery, creation, composition, testing, and deployment of full-stack data-centered services and applications in the cloud. SmartCLIDE will provide high levels of abstraction at all stages (development, testing, deployment, and run-time) as well as self-discovery of IaaS and SaaS Services. SmartCLIDE will provide several categories of abstractions: at development stage, SmartCLIDE will provide abstractions on data transformations or processing at testing stage, mechanisms to visualize flow and status or artifacts to automatically test the expected behavior at deployment stage, abstractions of physical and virtual resources or at runtime, mechanisms to monitor the performance and operation of the service The cloud nature of the environment will enable collaboration between different stakeholders, and the self-discovery of IaaS and SaaS services and the high levels of abstraction will facilitate the composition and deployment of new services to nontechnical staff (with no previous experience on programming or on the administration of systems and infrastructure). Equally, hiding the complexity of the infrastructure, and adding intelligence to this layer, will allow selecting the most adequate infrastructure services in each moment. SmartCLIDE will allow SMEs and Public Administration to boost the adoption of Cloud solutions, being validated at one solution-oriented to Public Administration (Social Security System) and three different IoT products of software development SMEs within the consortium.

So by navigating once again in the Assets Tab, you can see the Rest Asset as well. And by selecting the \"Deploy\" button from the top right, the project is being build and deployed. So now that our project is deployed if we want to create a process instance of our workflow, we navigate from the top menu to the \"Process Definitions\". From here you are able to see all the processes, and you can start a new instance like this: Now we can navigate to the Manage of \"Process Instances\" like this: From here we see all the Process Instances that are active or have finished. We can see that our Process Instance is finished since it had to do only an API call. And if we select it, we can see more information about it.","title":"Deploy"},{"location":"workflows/example2/","text":"Example 2 For this example we are going to create a more complex workflow, as an extension from the first example. Design First things first we are going to start from the previous workflow, and we are going to add 2 public variable. This can be done from the properties of the projects (when nothing is selected from the diagram). As it is visible from the following figure, you can add a new \"Process Variable\" in the \"Process Data\" section. - A variable with name \"data\" and the type \"String\". - A variable with name \"data2\" and the type \"String\". So, after that we can use this variable in order to store our API request result. By selecting the Rest Task, and navigating to the Assignments once again, in the \"Data Outputs and Assignments\" section we can do the following. We can simply select our first public variable from the dropdown list from the \"Target\" column for the Results. Like the following figure. From there we can add an \"Exclusive\" Gateway, in order to check if the \"data\" variable is empty, and make another call or end the workflow accordingly. The workflow is going to look like the following diagram. In order to create the true-false value that the Gateway is going to use, we select the arrow that goes to the End and from the Implementation/Execution section we could add the following. In the \"Process Variable\" we select the variable \"data\", and in the \"Condition\" we can select the \"Is empty\". Also, in the arrow that goes to the second Rest Task we can add the opposite in the following way. After that, in the second Rest Task like before we add the \"Url\", \"Method\", and in the output we could use the variable \"data2\". Deploy After these changes we can Save our workflow, and we deploy it like before. By navigating once more to the \"Process Definitions\" in order to Start a new instance. We don't provide any initial values to our variables, and we select \"Submit\". And in the Tab \"Process Variables\" we can see that both of our variables were populated. And in the Tab Diagram we can even see the Tasks that were executed.","title":"Example 2"},{"location":"workflows/example2/#example-2","text":"For this example we are going to create a more complex workflow, as an extension from the first example.","title":"Example 2"},{"location":"workflows/example2/#design","text":"First things first we are going to start from the previous workflow, and we are going to add 2 public variable.
