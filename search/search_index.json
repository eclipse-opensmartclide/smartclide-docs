For more general information about the SmartCLIDE project visit our website . About the project The main objective of SmartCLIDE is to propose a radically new smart cloud-native development environment, based on the coding-by-demonstration principle, that will support creators of cloud services in the discovery, creation, composition, testing, and deployment of full-stack data-centered services and applications in the cloud. SmartCLIDE will provide high levels of abstraction at all stages (development, testing, deployment, and run-time) as well as self-discovery of IaaS and SaaS Services. SmartCLIDE will provide several categories of abstractions: at development stage, SmartCLIDE will provide abstractions on data transformations or processing at testing stage, mechanisms to visualize flow and status or artifacts to automatically test the expected behavior at deployment stage, abstractions of physical and virtual resources or at runtime, mechanisms to monitor the performance and operation of the service The cloud nature of the environment will enable collaboration between different stakeholders, and the self-discovery of IaaS and SaaS services and the high levels of abstraction will facilitate the composition and deployment of new services to nontechnical staff (with no previous experience on programming or on the administration of systems and infrastructure). Equally, hiding the complexity of the infrastructure, and adding intelligence to this layer, will allow selecting the most adequate infrastructure services in each moment. SmartCLIDE will allow SMEs and Public Administration to boost the adoption of Cloud solutions, being validated at one solution-oriented to Public Administration (Social Security System) and three different IoT products of software development SMEs within the consortium. Modules The SmartCLIDE platform consists of the following modules: Context Handling Service Creation Service Creation Service Maintenance Test Generation Design Patterns Service Discovery Smart Assistant (Deep Learning Engine - DLE) Consortium The SmartCLIDE Consortium consists of the following partners: ATB Netcompany-Intrasoft AIR University of Macedonia (UoM) Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH) The Open Group Eclipse Foundation Wellness Telecom UNPARALLEL CONTACT Software KAIROS Digital Solutions License Distributed under the Eclipse Public License 2.0.
